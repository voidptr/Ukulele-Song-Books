\[Am]That split the night
And touched the \[G]sound of \[Am]silence.

Silence like a cancer \[Am]grows.
Hear my words that I \[F]might teach \[C]you,

But my \[F]words like silent raindrops \[C]fell,
And echoed
In the \[G]wells of \[Am]silence

And the people bowed and \[G]prayed
To the neon God they \[Am]made.

\[G]   I \[D]heard you crying \[Em]loud\[C]
\[G]   all the \[D]way across \[Em]town\[C]
You've been \[G]searching for that \[D]someone
and it's \[Em]me out on the \[C]prowl
As \[G]you sit around \[D]feeling so\[Em]rry for your\[C]self

\[G]  Well \[D]Don't get lonely \[Em]now\[C]
\[G]  And \[D]Dry your whining \[Em]eyes\[C]
I'm just \[G]roaming for the \[D]moment
Sleazin' \[Em]my back yard so don't \[C]get
\[G]so uptight you \[D]been thinking about \[Em]ditching me\[C]
\endverse

\[G]   I \[D]heard it all be\[Em]fore\[C]

\[G]  So \[D]go do what you \[Em]like\[C]
\[G]   Make \[D]sure you do it \[Em]wise\[C]
You may \[G]find out that your \[D]self-doubt

if it's \[Em]just not \[C]right
