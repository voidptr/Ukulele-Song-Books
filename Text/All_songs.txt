American Pie – Don McLean

         

  G     D    Em7 
A long, long time ago, 
  Am            C                Em                   D 
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile 
     G      D    Em7 
And I know if I had my chance, 
     Am                 C                Em              C           D 
That I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while 
    Em       Am                   Em          Am 
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver 
C        G      Am        C                        D 
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step 
  G          D        Em           Am7            D 
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride 
G         D          Em 
Something touched me deep inside 
    C       D7    G    C   G 
The day the music died  

  
CHORUS: 
   G    C        G        D 
So bye, bye Miss American Pie 
         G            C            G        D 
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry 
         G        C                  G           D 
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye 
        Em                          A7   Em                          D7 
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die 

   
G                 Am       
Did you write the book of love 
       C                 Am         Em           D 
And do you have faith in god above, if the bible tells you so? 
G      D          Em 
Do you believe in rock and roll 
    Am7             C               Em                      A7         D 
Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow? 
       Em                  D                     Em              D 
Well I know that you're in love with him  'cuz I saw you dancin' in the gym 
    C           G        A7           C                    D7 
You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues  
        G      D       Em                   Am                   C 
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck  
    G      D     Em              C       D7    G  C  G 
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died, I started singin'   


CHORUS  

             G                                 Am
Now for ten years we've been on our own,
      C                               Am                                       Em                            D   
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that's not how it used to be
               G          D                    Em
When the jester sang for the king and queen  
        Am7          C                                               Em               A7                           D
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean in a voice that came from you and me   



      Em                             D                            Em                         D
And while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown  
      C               G          A7           C                           D7
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
                G         D          Em                           Am                                      C   
And while Lenon read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park
      G             D                     Em            C            D7        G    C  G  
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died, we were singin'    

CHORUS  


Helter skelter in a summer swelter 
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter, eight miles high and fallin' fast 
It landed foul on the grass 
the players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines in a cast 
Now at halftime there was sweet perfume, while sergeants played a marching tune 
We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance 
'Cuz the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield 
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died, we started singin'   


CHORUS


And there we were all in one place, 
a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again 
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, 
Jack Flash sat on a candle stick, 'cuz fire is the devil's only friend 
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage 
No angel born in Hell could break that Satan's spell 
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite 
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died, he was singin'   


CHORUS

   G     D        Em 
I met a girl who sang the blues  
      Am                 C               Em                          D 
And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away  
  G         D      Em 
I went down to the sacred store  
          Am              C                     Em                 C 
Where I'd heard the music years before, but the man there said the music          D 
wouldn't play  
    Em                 Am                     Em                   Am 
But in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
    C     G        Am          C                     D 
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken                                               G         D   Em                     Am7     C            D7 
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost  
G               D          Em                Am7     D7    G 
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,  
D7 
And they were singin'   

FINAL CHORUS:  
So bye, bye Miss American Pie   
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry     
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye 
        C                D7         G    C   G 
Singin' this will be the day that I die.

        Bm 
Can you show me where it hurts?

D                          A 
There is no pain you are receding
D                             A 
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                              G 
You are only coming through in waves
C                                           G 
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                     A 
When I was a child I had a fever
   D                        A 
My hands felt just like two ballons
C                               G 
Now I've got that feeling once again
                     C 
I can't explain, you would not understand

            Bm 
But you may feel a little sick

Bm      Bm(9)     Bm 
Can you stand up?
                  A 
I do believe it's working, good
                 G 
That'll keep you going through the show
     Bm 
Come on it's time to go.

D                           A 
There is no pain, you are receding

A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                              G 
You are only coming through in waves

Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                         A 
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
D                       A 
Out of the corner of my eye
C                           G 
I turned to look but it was gone
                       C 
I cannot put my finger on it now
   
The child is grown
      G 
The dream is gone

Asus4   A  G  C (9 fr.)     G                D 
And  I________ have become comfortably numb.

When you were here before

You look like an angel

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,

What a dream I had 
G                Em 
Pressed in organdy 
D 
Clothed in crinoline 
Cmj7 
Of smoky burgundy 
G         A 
Softer than the rain   


D 	
I wandered empty streets down 
G                Em  
Past the shop displays 
D 	
I heard cathedral bells 
Cmj7 
Dripping down the alleyways 
G    A 
As I walked on   


D 
And when you ran to me, your 
G                       Em  
Cheeks flushed with the night 
D 
We walked on frosted fields 
Cmj7 
Of juniper and lamplight 
G  A   
I held your hand    


D 
And when I awoke 
G                     Em 
And felt you warm and near 
D 	
I kissed your honey hair 
Cmj7 
With my grateful tears 
G          A 
Oh, I love you girl 
Cmj7 G A   Dsus4 
Oh, I love you


Homeward Bound – Simon and Garfunkel

       
   

    A 
I'm sitting in the railway station. 
      Amaj7                  A7    F# 
Got a ticket for my destination, mmmm 
Bm                               G 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
    A                                  E7               A 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band.   


         D            A 
Homeward bound,  wish I was, 
         D 
Homeward bound, 
A             Asus4 
Home where my thought's escaping 
A             Asus4 
Home where my music's playing, 
A             Asus4 
Home where my love lays waiting 
E           A 
Silently for me. 


A 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
   Amaj7               A7      F# 
Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm 
    Bm                                  G 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
    A                             E7                       A 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,   


         D            A 
Homeward bound,  wish I was, 
         D 
Homeward bound, 
A             Asus4 
Home where my thought's escaping 
A             Asus4 
Home where my music's playing, 
A             Asus4 
Home where my love lays waiting 
E           A 
Silently for me. 

 
  A 
Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
     Amaj7                 A7     F# 
I'll play the game and pretend, mmmm 
    Bm                              G 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
     A                      E7                      A 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.    

         D            A 
Homeward bound,  wish I was, 
         D 
Homeward bound, 
A             Asus4 
Home where my thought's escaping 
A             Asus4 
Home where my music's playing, 
A             Asus4 
Home where my love lays waiting 
E           A 
Silently for me. 
Amaj7       A7       A   
   Silently for me.

Sound of Silence – Simon and Garfunkel

    

Am                        G    
   Hello darkness, my old friend,
                           Am 
I've come to talk with you again,
                     F       C 
Because a vision softly creeping,
                        F       C 
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping,
        F                             C 
And the vision that was planted in my brain
        Am 
Still remains
           G        Am 
Within the sound of silence.


                              G 
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        Am 
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                   F        C 
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                          F        C 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        F                                        C 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light                Am 
That split the night
                G        Am 
And touched the sound of silence.


                         G 
And in the naked light I saw
                           Am 
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                   F       C 
People talking without speaking,
                   F        C 
People hearing without listening,
               F                       C 
People writing songs that voices never share

           Am 
And no one dare
            G        Am 
Disturb the sound of silence.
                          G 
Fools said ah, you do not know
                      Am 
Silence like a cancer grows.
                     F           C 
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                    F           C 
Take my arms that I might reach you.
       F                           C 
But my words like silent raindrops fell,  

And echoed
       G        Am 
In the wells of silence


                         G 
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Am 
To the neon God they made.
                         F       C 
And the sign flashed out it's warning,
                      F     C 
In the words that it was forming.
                       F 
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
    Am                    C 
Are written on the subway walls
             C 
And tenement halls.
    Am               G         Am 
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.
                     /                 /                     
          Picking, here           to here


 
Staring At The Sun – U2

Intro: Am,G,F,Em x3

Verse 1:

Am                       G
Summer stretching on the grass
F              Em
Summer dresses pass
Am           G
In the shade of a willow tree
F                 Em
Creeps a crawling over me
Am          G
Over me and over you
F              Em
Stuck together with God`s glue
Am                G
It`s going to get stickier too

F 
It`s been a long hot summer
F#m-5 
Let`s get under the covers 
F
Don`t try too hard to think 
G
Don`t think at all

                 C
I`m not the only one
               Am
Starin` at the sun
                     F
Afraid of what you`d find
                   G
If you took a look inside
                  C
Not just deaf and dumb
               Am
Staring at the sun
             F
Not the only one 
                  G 
Who`s happy to go blind 

Am, D x2




Verse 2:

There`s an insect in your ear 
If you scratch it won`t disappear 
It`s gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you want to see what the scratching brings 
Waves that leave me out of reach 
Breaking on your back like a beach 
Will we ever live in peace?
`Cause those that can`t do often have to 
Those that can`t do often have to preach

Chorus:

To the ones staring at the sun 
Afraid of what you`d find 
If you took a look inside 
Not just deaf and dumb Staring at the sun
I`m not the only one 
Who`s happy to go blind

Verse 3:

Intransigence is all around 
Military still in town 
Armour plated suits and ties 
Daddy just won`t say goodbye 
Referee won`t blow the whistle 
God is good but will he listen 
I`m nearly great
But there`s something I`m missing 
I left in the duty free 
Though you never really belonged to me

Chorus:

You`re not the only one 
Starin` at the sun 
Afraid of what you`d find 
If you stepped back inside 
I`m not sucking my thumb 
I`m staring at the sun 
Not the only one
Who’s happy to go blind

F     F#m-5 
Ah ah I
Ah ah I
Ah ah I
Ah ah I 
 
The Boxer – Simon and Garfunkel
      
C                                              Am 
I am just a poor boy, though my story’s seldom told        
       G                              G7 
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, 
         C
such are promises 
               Am            G                 F
  All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear 
               C     G G7 G C 
and disregards rest. 

       C                                                Am 
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy 
       G                            G7         G                  
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of a railway 
         C 
station, running scared 
       Am           G                     
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged 
       C
people go 
        G              F    G    G7    C 
Looking for the places only they would know.

       C                                          Am 
Asking only workman’s wages, I come looking for a job 
             G 
But I get no offers, 
       G7               G             C
just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue 
       Am               G                F
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome, 
                    C     G G7 G C
I took some comfort there
Ooh la la, la la la la.

        C                                              Am 
And I’m laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone 
      G               G7 
Going home, where the New York City winters aren’t 
C            G           Am    G         
Bleeding me, Leading me, going home. 

       C                                            Am 
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade        
       G                        G7               G      
And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down 
   C                                              Am     
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame

“I am leaving, I am leaving” but the fighter still remains.

Boys of Summer – Don Henley
    

Em 
Nobody on the road  
Em
Nobody on the beach   
C                     
I feel it in the air  
C
The summer's out of reach   
D                         
Empty lake, empty streets  
D
The sun goes down alone   
C                          
I'm drivin' by your house  
C
Though I know you're not at home       

G  
But I can see you-   
D   
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun   
D                                     C    
Ydou got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby   G                    D   
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   
D                 C                  
After the boys of summer have gone       

Em
I never will forget those nights  
Em
wonder if it was a dream   
C 
Remember how you made me crazy? 
C
Remember how I made you scream   
D                     
Now I don't understand

what happened to our love   
C   
But babe, I'm gonna get you back                        
C
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of       
I can see you-   
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun   
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone   I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   
After the boys of summer have gone      

Em                                 
Out on the road today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a Cadillac   
C                                      
A little voice Inside my head said, 
C
Don't look back. You can never look back.   
D   
I thought I knew what love was   
D   
what did I know?   
C   
Those days are gone forever    
C
I should just let them go but-       

I can see you-   
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun   
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby   
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   After the boys of summer have gone       

I can see you-   
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun   
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby   I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   
After the boys of summer have gone    

 
 

 
The Hounds of Winter – Sting

   
   

Intro: A Abm Bm A D Bm E F# (2x)
A       Abm
Mercury falling
Bm             A
I rise from my bed
D                        Bm
Collect my thoughts together
E                 F#
I have to hold my head
A                   G#m
It seems that she's gone
Bm               A
And somehow I am pinned by
D             Bm
The Hounds of Winter
E              F#
Howling in the wind

I walk through the day
My coat around my ears
I look for my companion
I have to dry my tears
It seems that she's gone
Leaving me too soon
I'm as dark as December
I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon

I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down



I can't make up the fire
The way that she could
I spend all my days
In the search for dry wood
Board all the windows and 
close the front door
I can't believe 
she won't be here anymore

I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down

A season for joy
A season for sorrow
Where she's gone
I will surely, surely follow
She brightened my day
She warmed the coldest night
The Hounds of Winter
They got me in their sights

I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome, lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They harry me down


 
USS Make Shit Up - Voltaire

    

D G D A D G A D

Verse 1:
D                           G
I was stranded on a planet, just me and Spock
D                             A
we met a nasty nazi alien who locked our asses up
D                                G
We found a hunk of crystal and a metal piece of bed
A                                              D
We made a laser phaser gun and shot him in the head

D                               G
I was standing on a bridge when Sulu came to me
D                                    A
his eyes were full of tears he said "captain cant you see
D                         G
the ship is gonna blow do something I beseech"
A                                                  
I grabbed a tribble and some chewing gum and stopped the 
          D
warp core breach

Chorus:
and I say
D                               G
Bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish
D                              A
thats the way we do things lad We make shit up as we wish
D                             G
the klingons and the romulans pose no threat to us
A                                                     D
cuz if we find we're in a bind we just make some shit up

D   G     F#m                          G     A
la, da da da, da da da, la da da da da daaa, daaa

Verse 2:
Although he’s just a child and something of a twit
Wesley is the master when it comes to making up some shit
he's the guy you want with you when you go out in space
if only he could beam those pimples off his face

and if you're at a party on the starship enterprise
and the karaoke player just plain old up and dies
set up an neutrino field inside a can of peas
hold on to Geordi's visor and sing into data's knee

Chorus

Verse 3:
Sisko's on a mission to go no bloody place
he loiters on the space station above Bajoran space
the wormhole opened up and now they come from near and far
we'll keep the booze but please send back the fucking Jem-hadar

What is with the Klingons, remember in the day
they looked like Puerto Ricans and they dressed in gold lamé
now they look like heavy metal rockers from the dead
with leather pants and frizzy hair and lobsters on their heads

Chorus

Verse 4:
I was stuck on Voyager and pounding on the door
when suddenly it dawned on me I've seen this show before
perhaps I'm in a warp bubble and slightly out of phase
It was way back in the sixties when they called it Lost in Space

we were looking for a way to 	
make the ratings soar
so we orchestrated an encounter with the Borg
normally you'd think that would get us into shit
But this one has a smashing ass and a lovely set of tits

Chorus (End):
and I say
Bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish
That's the way we do things lad We make shit up as we wish
the Klingons and the Romulans pose no threat to us
A                                    G
cuz if we find we're in a bind we're totally screwed but nevermind
A
we'll pull something out of our behind...
A                         D
we’ll just make some shit up

What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Am          F           C          G 
Everyone I know   goes away in the end
    Am                F       G            G 
And you could have it all     My empire of dirt
Am              F     G                G 
I will let you down   I will make you hurt
   Am              F        G              G
If I could start again   A million miles away
Am             F     *G  (*one single strum only) 
I would keep myself   I would find a way

Sudden motion made me skip, now were into a brand new trick

How, in every visible way you shine,

as if the stars in your wake align

Almost impossible to malign  
EGD          DFC             ACG         EGD 
But just below where you shine you burn,

although I know it, I never learn  
             DFC           ACG       EGD 
Just goes to show that I can't discern  

CHORUS:

Aluminum to me, aluminium to some.

You'd never rust but I'd never know

You can't be trusted, I can't let go

You're so lightweight, how can you survive?

Recycling moments from others' lives

You're not as precious as you contrive  


 DFC   ACG      EGD      DFC   ACG     EGD

The Drinking Song – Moxy Früvous
         
        G    D7     G 
And the band played on         
       G    C      D 
As the helicopters whirred  
C            A7          G     Em 
Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn     
   G      D       G 
My senses finally blurred  

Verse 1: 
D7         G            C                G 
  He was a rock, to the end a solid reminder           
         Am     D7 
Couldn't deny a friend  
D7                G             C           G 
  We lived in the noise and the sweet amber poison 
Bm                          C 
Peekin' up the skirt of the end  
D7         G      C                         G 
  And we'd drink, two gnarly dudes and some records                               
          Am              D7 
Much like plates of black food  
D7               G      C            G 
We filled up our faces, saw some far places  
Bm                       C    D7 
Stood on the roof in the nude  

        G    D7     G 
And the band played on         
       G    C      D 
As the helicopters whirred  
C            A7          G     Em 
Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn     
   G      D       G 
My senses finally blurred  

Verse 2:
Between poles, he said "we're like cows in the grass" D7 G C G 
Brushing off flies                                    Am D7 
Chaise lounging around standing up, falling down      D7 G C G
'Till we no longer opened our eyes                    Bm C
And we'd drink, ever notice how drinking's like war   D7 G C G
Cup 'o' troops o'er the gums                          Am D7
To the end of our health a campaign 'gaisnt myself    D7 G C G 
Armed with bourbons and scotches and rums             Bm C D7

-Chorus-  

Verse 3:
Think of bombs, we're poised on the edge of disaster D7 G C G
Whether it's right or it's wrong                     Am D7
We opened the window, played some Nintendo           D7 G C G
Sang a few bars of some pretty old song:             Bm C	

  G C   G          D     G 	
  Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight          
  G         G7       C 	
  Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene               
  G      D7     G        D7 	
  I'll see you in my dreams  

Oh to dream, those impotent bones of extinction     D7 G C G
Flying graceful and free                            Am D7
None but the best cause the man cannot rest         D7 G C G
'Till he's finally beaten his me                    Bm C D7

-Chorus-  

Verse 4: 
                                                    D7 G C G
'Till the end, he passed out on the sun deck that morning 
Quietly saying goodbye                              Am D7
But I was so hammered I sputtered and stammered     D7 G C G
Told him he couldn't just die                       Bm C
He was a rock, went straight for his own armageddon D7 G C G
Face froze in a grin                                Am D7
Ambulance flyin' in. I never drank again            D7 G C G
Can't really call that a loss or a win              Bm C D7

        G    D7     G 
And the band played on 
       G    C      D 
As the helicopters whirred  
C            A7          G     Em 
Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn  
   G      D       C     G

Life For Rent – Dido

      

  Am                                            F
I haven't really ever found a place that I call home
  Am                                      F
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
   Am                                  F
I apologize that once again I'm not in love
                     Am                                 F
But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking
            Dm              G7
It's just a thought, only a thought
          C    G         F
But if my life___ is for rent 
      C     G        F   G
and I don't learn to buy 
         C             G           F   G
Well I deserve nothing more than I get 
               C    G           F
'Cos nothing I have___ is truly mine

     Am                                              F
I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea
   Am                                   F
To travel the world alone and live more simply
       Am                              F
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
             Am                          F
'Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me
            Dm              G7
It's just a thought, only a thought

         C          G            Dm           G
While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
           C            G         Dm         G
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
             Dm         G7
Well how can I say I'm alive?

Oh Susanna – Stephen Foster

  C                                    G7
I came from Alabama wid my banjo on my knee,
    C                               G7     C
I’m g’wan to Louisiana my true love for to see,
                                                       G7
It rain’d all night the day I left, the weather it was dry,
    C                                     G7        C    G7
The sun so hot I frose to death; Susanna, don't you cry.

Chorus:
F                C                 G7
Oh! Susanna, Oh! don't you cry for me,
     C                               G7    C
I’ve come from Alabama, wid my banjo on my knee. 

I jumped aboard de telegraph, 
And trabbelled down de ribber,
De Lectrie fluid magnified,
And killed five hundred Nigger
De bullgine bust, de horse run off,
I realy thought I’d die;
I shut my eyes to hold my breath,
Susanna, don't you cry.

-Chorus- 

I had a dream de odder night
When ebery ting was still;
I thought I saw Susanna,
A coming down de hill.
The buckwheat cake war in her mouth,
The tear was in her eye,
Says I’m coming from de South,
Susanna, don't you cry.

-Chorus-

I scon will be in New Orleans,
And den I’ll look all round,
And when I find Susanna,
I’ fall upon the ground.
But if I do not find her,
Dis darkie ’I surely die,
And when I’m dead and buried,
Susanna, don't you cry.

-Chorus-

Intro:  |C  |Csus4 |C  |Csus4 |

C                    Csus4                C       Csus4
Welcome to my secret lair on Skullcrusher Mountain
  C                             Csus4
I hope that you've enjoyed your stay so far
          C7
I see you met my assistant Scarface
      F                     C
His appearance is quite disturbing
        F                       G7
but I assure you he's harmless enough
       F                    C
He's a sweetheart, calls me Master
             F      G7      F      G7    
And he has a way of finding pretty things
    F                G7
and bringing them to me

C
I'm so into you
        Gm
But I'm way too smart for you
        F
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
           Fm
I'm not surprised that you agree
             C
If you could find some way to be
             Gm
A little bit less afraid of me
              F
You'd see the voices that control me
       Fm
from inside my head
    Bb7                 C       Csus4 
Say I shouldn't kill you....yet

  C                        Csus4             C         Csus4
I made this half-pony half-monkey monster to please you
C                          Csus4
But I get the feeling that you don't like it
C7
What's with all the screaming?
         F                 C
You like monkeys, you like ponies
          F                      G7
Maybe you don't like monsters so much

        F             C
Maybe I used too many monkeys
         F         G7          F        G7
Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony
F                 G7
making a gift for you?

C
I'm so into you
        Gm
But I'm way too smart for you
        F
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
           Fm
I'm not surprised that you agree

Say I shouldn't kill you....yet

            F                         Em
Picture the two of us alone inside my golden submarine
         F                  G7           
While up above the waves my doomsday squad
  C             C7
ignites the atmosphere
            F                   
And all the fools who lead their foolish lives
    Em             A7
may find it quite explosive
        Dm                              F                G7
Well it won't mean half as much to me if I don't have you here

    C                         Csus4                C        Csus4
You know it isn't easy living here on Skullcrusher Mountain
   C                             Csus4
So maybe you could cut me just a little slack
         C7
Would it kill you to be civil?

          F                  C
I've been patient, I've been gracious
         F                        G7
And this mountain is covered with wolves
          F                  C
Hear them howling, my hungry children
                 F        G7     F     G7
Maybe you should stay and have another drink
    F                  G7
and think about me and you


C
I'm so into you
        Gm
But I'm way too smart for you
        F
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
           Fm
I'm not surprised that you agree
             C
If you could find some way to be

You'd see the voices that control me

Say I shouldn't kill you yet

I shouldn't kill you yet
Bb7                 C    Csus4 C
I shouldn't kill you yet

A           C    
In my eyes, indisposed
G                       F#m
In disguise as no one knows

Hides the face, lies the snake
    A   G        Bb  
The sun in my disgrace

Boiling heat, summer stench

Call my name through the cream

Won't you come

Won't you come        

Stuttering, cold and damp                A C
Steal the warm wind tired friend         G F#m
Times are gone for honest men            F E
And sometimes far too long for snakes    A G Bb
In my shoes, a walking sleep             A C
And my youth I pray to keep              G F#m
Heaven send Hell away                    F E
No one sings like you anymore            A G Bb

~Chorus~

Hang my head, drown my fear              A C
Till you all just disappear              G F#m

Since the world's been turning
G                   D
We didn't start the fire
         Am
But when we are gone
        C                  G       D       Am     C
Will it still burn on, and on, and on, and on   3x

Hotel California – The Eagles	

        

strumming pattern: DDUUDUD...DD.

Am                        E7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                     D               
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                         C
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm	
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
I had to stop for the night

Am                              E7       
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G                                     
And I was thinking to myself 
              D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                         C
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm	
There were voices down the corridor, 
E	
I thought I heard them say...

CHORUS:
F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                   Am
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
F                                       C
There's Plenty of room at the Hotel California
     Dm                           E
Anytime of year,(anytime of year) You can find us here...

Am                           E7
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, She got a mercedes benz
G                                   D                     
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends
F                                 C
How they danced in the court yard sweet summer sweat

Dm                     E
Some dance to remember some dance to forget

Am                          E7
So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
G                                     D 
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
F                                      C
and still those voice are calling from far away
Dm
Wake you up in the middle of the night
E 
Just to hear them say

CHORUS:
F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
E7                   Am
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
F                                     C
They’re living it up at the Hotel California
     Dm                          E
What a nice surprise; bring your alibis

Am                      E7
Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
G                               D  
We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                             C
and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm	
They stab it with their steely knives but they
E
just can't kill the beast

Am                     E7  
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                  D  
I had find the passage back to the place I was before 
F                           C
"Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
Dm
You can check out anytime you like
E
But you can never leave...

Stairway To Heaven – Led Zeppelin                             
          
Intro: Am G C D F G Am

          Am         G             C           D  
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
          F                     G  Am  
and she's buying a stairway to  heaven 
         Am             G            C              D  
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed 
       F                         G    Am  
with a word she can get what she came for 
C D  F  Am             C        G           D  
Oh___oh____  and she's buying a stairway to heaven 
          C           D            F           Am  
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
           C              D              F 
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings 
       
     Am          G               C            D  
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings 
          F                       G  Am      
Sometimes all of her thoughts are misgiven

Am G C D F G Am 

G Am7 Am Dsus2 D                           Am7 Am Em D C D
                 Oh___ it makes me wonder                                
Am7 Am Dsus2 D                           Am7 Am Em D C D
               Oh___  it makes me wonder                   

          C         G          Am  
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west  
       C         G          F  Am  
and my spirit is crying for leaving 
      C               G             Am  
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees 
        C         G               F  Am      C 
and the voices of those who stand looking 
G Am7 Am Dsus2  D                           Am7 Am Em D C D  
                Oh___     it makes me wonder                   
Am7 Am Dsus2  D                           Am7  Am  D  C  D  
              Oh___  it  really makes me wonder                   



         Am             G          C            D
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
         F                     G  Am
then the piper will lead us to reason 
And the new day will dawn for those who stand long 
and the forest will echo with laughter 

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now 
it's just a spring clean for the May queen 
Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run 
there's still time to change the road you're on 
...and it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know 
the piper's calling you to join him 
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know 
your stairway lies on the whispering wind 

D Dsus2 D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Dsus4 C Cadd9 C Cadd9 C  
                                                  
Am        G                F    G Am 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul 
There walks the lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
how everything still turns to gold 
And if you listen very hard 
the truth will come to you at last 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll 

          F                    G  Am  
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

Intro: Amaj7Fmaj7, Emaj7Cmaj7 (x2)

                     Amaj7Fmaj7
You walked into the room
         Emaj7Cmaj7
And the whole place stopped to notice
                 Amaj7Fmaj7          Emaj7Cmaj7
Standing next to you, I feel hopeless and you know this
C#mAm               Amaj7Fmaj7
I've never been ashamed of my attraction
C#mAm                  Amaj7Fmaj7         BG
I'd be happy if you gave me just a fraction
         Emaj7Cmaj7          E7C7         Amaj7Fmaj7
As we danced, I could see in your eyes
        AmFm                              Emaj7Cmaj7
You and me as senior citizens in love

I followed your perfume out away from all the rabble
Right up to your room for a drink and travel Scrabble
You, stationed in the warm glow of the T.V.
Too patient as I'm playing L-O-V-E
And we laugh...and we laugh...and we laugh
And we have to or we'll end up in the bath

Now we're in the bath, I'm already thinking marriage
I know that in the past it was something I'd disparage
You turned down all the lights, I lit the candles
We rolled around in robes and hotel sandals
Then you slept, and I dressed, and I left
And I guess I'll see you Monday like before

  C#mAm          Amaj7Fmaj7         Emaj7Cmaj7
Before all the fireworks exploded
C#mAm       Amaj7Fmaj7             Emaj7Cmaj7
Our conversations were so loaded, innuendo flying
C#mAm          CAb   Amaj7Fmaj7   Emaj7Cmaj7
Now what can we say?

          Amaj7Fmaj7
Have a nice day
           Emaj7Cmaj7        Amaj7Fmaj7
Looks like rain today
           Emaj7Cmaj7
What'd you say?
                Amaj7Fmaj7    Emaj7Cmaj7
Doesn't matter anyway

Now I'm in a cab, heading back to my apartment
Everything is drab, and I wish it never started
Now I've landed in this awkward situation
How can I just avoid a conversation?
So I wait, come in late. It'd be great
If you transferred out of state

When I Fall – Barenaked Ladies
     
INTRO:  C F G Am F  (x2) 
                       C       G                  Am      F 
I look straight in the window, try not to look below 
                C          G                 D        F 
Pretend I'm not up here,      I try counting sheep 
                  C        G             Am        F
The sheep seem to shower,    off this office tower 
         C              G                  D       F
It's 9.8 straight down,    I can't stop my knees. 

CHORUS: 
                Am            G                   D       F 
I wish I could fly, from this building, from this wall. 
                Am             G               D       F 
And if I should try, would you catch me, if I fall.  

C F G Am F  
                   C           G             Am      F 
My hands clench the squeegee,     a secular rosary 
               C        G                  D       F
Hang onto your wallet,     hang onto your rings. 
            C          G                Am          F 
I can't look below me,   something might throw me.
               C              G                  D       F
I curse at the windstorms,          that October brings. 

              C           G             Am            F
I look in the boardroom,     a modern Pharaoh's tomb. 
                C         G                  D       F
I'd gladly swap places,      if they care to dive 
                   C          G                 Am      F
They're lined up at the window,      peer down into limbo 
               C         G               D         F
Frightened of jumping,      in case they survive. 

               F                   G        
I wish I could step, from this scaffold, 
     Am                   D        
Onto soft green grass and shopping malls, 
    F           G              Am            G         
or bed, with my family, and my pastor and my grandfather 
      D     F 
who's dead. 

(softly)             C        G                Am         F
Look straight in the mirror,     watch it come clearer
                C         G                  D       F 
I look like a painter, behind all the grease. 
               C         G                  Am         F
But painting's creating,     and I'm just erasing 
                C         G                  D       F
A crystal clear canvas,          is my masterpiece. 


CHORUS: 
                Am            G                   D       F 
I wish I could fly, from this building, from this wall. 
                Am             G               D       F 
And if I should try, would you catch me, if I fall.  
                Am            G                   D       F 
I wish I could fly, from this building, from this wall. 
                Am             G               D       F 
And if I should try, would you catch me, if I fall.  

       C G Am F    C G D F
When I fall...     When I fall.... mmmmmm

Ooh, and they send you down to war, lord
G                       F            
And when you ask them, "how much should we give?"
C7                      G     G     G     G
Ooh, the only answer is more! more! more! yeah!

Under the Milky Way - The Church
    
Am                  Asus4         Fmaj7      G
Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty
The sound of their voice fades with the light
I think about the loveless facination
Under the Milky Way tonight

Lower the curtains down on Memphis
Lower the curtains down alright
I’ve got no time for private consultation
Under the milky way tonight

Chorus:
G                         Fmaj7
Wish I knew what you were looking for
G                         Fmaj7
might have known what you would find
G                         Fmaj7
Wish I knew what you were looking for
G                         Fmaj7
might have known what you would find

Am      Asus4          Fmaj7   G
And its somthing quite pecular
Something thats shimmering and white
It leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight

~Chorus~

Am      Asus4          Fmaj7   G
And its somthing quite pecular
Something thats shimmering and white
It leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight

Taking time the only way he knows

A Long December – Counting Crows
    

intro: G C Am C G C Am

C      G                    D         Am
A long December and there's reason to believe
      C                 G               C
Maybe this year will be better than the last
Am C       G                                D
   I can't remember the last thing that you said
            Am
as you were leavin'
        G             C
Now the days go by so fast
         G               C         Am    C
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         G                 C       Am    C
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       G                  C     Am (mute)          G
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would

Chorus:
G     C 
Na na na na
Am       D
Na na na na na na na na na
G C           Am 
  Na na na na yeah

C            G            D           
The smell of hospitals in winter
        Am                C            G               C  
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
       G             D
All at once you look across a crowded room
           C              G             C
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

         G               C         Am    C
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         G                 C         Am   C
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       G                       C       Am
If you think you might come to California...I think you should

~Chorus~

C               G              D              Am
Drove up to the Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
    C               G               C
And talked a little while about the year
            G                D              Am
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
          C             G
Makes you talk a little lower about
    C
the things you could not show her

                     G                    D         Am
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
      C                 G               C
Maybe this year will be better than the last
        G                D                Am
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
   C                G               C
To hold on to these moments as they pass

              G               C         Am
And it's been one more day up in the canyons
         G              C            Am
And it's one more night in Hollywood
     G                       C             Am
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should

~Chorus~

Em          C           Am
How can you see into my eyes 
          D 
like open doors
Em          C            Am
Leading you down into my core
             D

it back home

Wake me up inside

Wake me up inside

Call my name and save me from the dark

Bid my blood to run
Gm                   D
before I come undone
                 Em      C    Am
Save me from the nothing I've become

Em         C             Am
Now that I know what I'm without 
               D
you can't just leave me 
Em           C
Breathe into me 
            Am
and make me real
D
Bring me to life

Chorus

Bridge:
Am        Gm               C
Frozen inside without your touch

without your love darling

only you are the life among the dead

Spend all your time waiting for that second chance

you are pulled from the wreckage

you're in the arms of the angel

the storm keeps on twisting, keep on building the lies

that you make up for all that you lack

                 Dm          F
it don't make no difference, escape one last time

it's easier to believe

in this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness

brings me to my knees

you are pulled from the wreckage

you're in the arms of the angel

may you fi-ind some comfort here

you're in the arms of the angel

      Dm                          E7
he said "can't crush them under your heel"
      Am           E7
Jayne strapped on his hat
      Am       Dm
and in 5 seconds flat
      Dsus2           E7           Am
stole everything Boss Higgins had to steal

~Chorus~

Verse 2:
      Am        E7           Am
Now here is what separates heroes
  Dm        E7       Am
From common folk like you and I
      Am          E7
The man they call Jayne
Am                   Dm
He turned 'round his plane
E7                     Am
And let that money hit sky
      Dm               Am
He dropped it onto our houses
      Dm               E7
He dropped it into our yards
      Am           E7
The man they call Jayne
      Am       Dm
He stole away our pain
    Dsus2  E7          Am              
And headed out for the stars

The Unforgiven - Metallica
      
Am                    Em       D                Am
New blood joins this earth and quickly he's sub-dued.
                         Em         D                      Am
Through constant pain disgrace, the young boy learns their rules.
                          Em      D                 Am
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong.
                    Em            D                   Am
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on.
                 C            G        C               G
He knows, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
    C                  G    E
his will they'll take away.

CHORUS:
Am        C               G           Em                          Am
What I've felt, what I've known never shined through in what I've shone.
Am    C         G          E                   Am
Never be. Never see. Won't see what might have been.
Am        C               G            Em               Am
What I've felt, what I've known, never shined through in what I've shone.
Am    C           G        E            Am
Never free. Never me. So I dub the unforgiven.

Am                  Em       D              Am
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
                        Em        D             Am
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
                        Em         D               Am
Throughout the life the same, he's battled constantly
                     Em     D              Am
This fight he cannot win. A tired man they see no longer cares.
    C            G           C            G
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
     C               G   E
That old man here is me.

~Chorus~

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
           C                      F            C
I've got a sweeter song, than the birds in the trees

(Chorus)

        C       F                 C
I don't need no money, fortune or fame
         C                     F           C
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim

Still Alive – Jonathan Coulton
        
               D       Bm
This was a tri-umph
D       Bm       D          Bm       D     Bm
    I'm making a note here: huge suc-cess
     Em           A              D        Bm     D
It's hard to over-state my satis-faction
Bm           D     Bm
Aperture Sci-ence
D      Bm         D       Bm       D     Bm
    We do what we must be-cause we can
Em              A                      Bb
For the good of all of us, ex-cept the ones who are dead

            F        C           Bb        F
But there's no sense crying over every mis-take
         F       C               Bb         F
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
        Gm           C            F           Dm
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
        Bb         A          D     Bm
For the people who are still alive

D     Bm     D     Bm

D       Bm       D       Bm
    I'm not even angry
D       Bm        D      Bm         D     Bm
        I'm being so sin-cere right now
Em              A                  D          Bm     D
Even though you broke my heart and killed me
    Bm             D     Bm
And tore me to pie-ces
D       Bm          D        Bm   D     Bm
    And threw every piece in-to a fire
Em                A                     Bb
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you

          F         C           Bb        F
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
          F      C              Bb         F
And we're out of beta, we're re-leasing on time
       Gm         C                F                 Dm
So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
        Bb         A           D     Bm
For the people who are still a-live

D     Bm     D     Bm

D   Bm           D        Bm
    Go ahead and leave me
D     Bm            D      Bm      D      Bm
    I think I'd pre-fer to stay in-side
Em                A               D         Bm     D
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Bm          D      Bm
Maybe Black Me-sa
D   Bm         D        Bm      D       Bm
    That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance
Em          A                          Bb
Anyway this cake is great, It's so del-icious and moist

        F        C                    Bb         F
Look at me still talking when there's science to do
       F        C                 Bb           F
When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you
        Gm           C             F              Dm
I've ex-periments to run, there is research to be done
       Bb         A           D      Bm
On the people who are still a-live

       D          Bm         D     Bm
And be-lieve me I am still a-live
          D           Bm          D     Bm
I'm doing science and I'm still a-live
           D          Bm          D     Bm
I feel fan-tastic and I'm still a-live
             D          Bm         D     Bm
While you're dying I'll be still a-live
                D           Bm         D     Bm
And when you're dead I will be still a-live
        D      Bm
Still A-live

Still A-live
 
Basket Case – Green Day
      
F               C
Do you have the time
Dm               Am
To listen to me whine
Bb                 F                C
About nothing and everything all at once

I am one of those

Melodramatic fools

Sometimes I give myself the creeps

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up

I think I'm cracking up

Am I just paranoid?
            F
I'm just stoned

F C Bb C x2

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life is a bore
And quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

~Chorus~

F C Bb C x4

Grasping to control

I tell them tenderly.

Carry On My Wayward Son – Kansas
        
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Am     G              F         G
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Am      G             F           G
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
Dm    C            Bb        Bb C  
I was soaring ever higher
Dm    C        G     
But I flew too high
Am        G                F           G
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Am        G                F           G
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
Dm         C               Bb           
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
Dm    C         G
I can hear them say
                          
Am    C     G       F     
Carry on my wayward son,  
Am          C          G
There'll be peace when you are done

Lay your weary head to rest, don't you cry no more
 
Am    G           F          G
Masquerading as a man with a reason
Am    G           F            G
My charade is the event of the season
Dm       C             Bb           Bb C
And if I claim to be a wise man
Dm        C                  G
It surely means that I don't know
Am   G             F      G
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Am     G                F           G
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
Dm    C                     Bb         Bb C
I set a course for winds of fortune
Dm    C               G
But I hear the voices say
                          
Am    C     G       F     
Carry on my wayward son,  
Am          C          G
There'll be peace when you are done
Am       C     G       F    F 
Lay your weary head to rest,  don't you cry no more

Am Am 
Carry on 
G        F    E F G A C
You will always remember
Am Am 
Carry on 
G        F      E F G A C    
Nothing  equals the splendor
Dm       C                Bb     Bb C
Now your life's no longer empty
Dm     C                G
Surely Heaven waits for you

Am    C     G       F     
Carry on my wayward son,

Intro: Bm, G, D, A (x2)

Bm              G     D               A
You come out at night that's when the energy comes
        Bm          G             D        A
And the dark side's light and the vampires roam
    Bm         G                   D       A
You strut your rasta wear and your suicide poem
      Bm           G          D           A     E          
And a cross from a faith that died before jesus came
                           G7  G
You're building a mystery

Bm, G, D, A

    Bm        G                D                 A
You live in a church where you sleep with voodoo dolls
        Bm                G              D             A
And you won't give up the search for the ghosts in the halls
              Bm             G          D                A
You wear your sandals in the snow and a smile that won't wash away
Bm                   G                   D              A
Can you look out the window without your shadow getting in the way
E            G
Oh you're so beautiful with an edge and a charm
E              A
But so careful when I’m in your arms
Bm            G        D          A
'Cause you're working, building a mystery
Bm      G      D          A
Holding on and holding it in
Bm          G        D          A           
Yeah you're working, building a mystery

and choosing so carefully
Bm          G                 D                A
You woke up screaming aloud a prayer from your secret god
Bm                   G         D              A
and you feed off our fears and hold back your tears
Bm        G           D              A
Give us a tantrum and through it all grin
Bm           G                 D        A
just when we need one when the evenings thin
E                        G	
Oh you're a beautiful, a beautiful fucked up man
E                                 G
You're setting up your razor wire shrine
Bm           G        D          A
Cause you're working, building a mystery
Bm             G
Holding on and holding it in
Bm          G        D          A            
Yeah you're working, building a mystery 
Bm  G
and choosing so carefully
Bm          G        D           
Yeah you're working, building a mystery

I’m so tired but I can’t sleep

Ikea – Jonathan Coulton
        
D    G      A       D
Long ago in days of yore
       G            A         D
It all began with a god named Thor
           A           Bm
There were Vikings and boats
         G                     D
And some plans for a furniture store
     D       G          A     D
It's not a bodega, it's not a mall
         G                A         D            A
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
      Bm          G                      D
As if there were apartments smaller than mine

  A  Bm G                     D                      D A Asus4
I-ke-a  just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
  A  Bm G                D                           D A Asus4         
I-ke-a selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
G        D     A7   Dsus4 A7
Everyone has a home
    G            D      A                    D    Dsus4 D
But if you don't have a home you can buy one there

D      G      A        D
So rent a car or take the bus
         G             A        D
Lay your cash down and put your trust
       A              Bm        G                       D
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
          G        A    D
Billy the bookcase says hello
              G           A         D
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
        A          Bm          G                              D
And the chair is a ladder-back birch but his friends call him Karl

  A  Bm G                     D                      D A Asus4

But if you don't have a home you can buy one there
Bm    F#
Ikea: plywood, brushed steel

All of them for free

I just bought a table for sixteen bucks
      A           Bm         G                          D
And a chair and a lamp And a shelf and some candles for you

I was a doubter just like you

Listen as the wind blows

from across the great divide.

Voices trapped in yearning

memories trapped in time

the night is my companion

and solitude my guide
F               Am
would I spend forever here
Dsus              D
and not be satisfied.

F           Am
And I would be the one
             Cmaj9
to hold you down
           F
kiss you so hard
            Dm     Am      F
I'll take your breath away,
               Am
and after I'd
		Cmaj9
wipe away the tears
Dm              Em        Am
just close your eyes dear.

Am
Through this would I've stumbled
G                     D     Dsus
so many times betrayed
Am
trying to find an honest word to find
G                   D     Dsus
the truth enslaved,
Am
oh you speak to me in riddles
G                     D     Dsus
and you speak to me in rhyme
Am
my body aches to breathe your breath
G                     D     Dsus
your words keep me alive

F           Am
And I would be the one
             Cmaj9
to hold you down
           F
kiss you so hard
            Dm     Am      F
I'll take your breath away,
               Am
and after I'd
		Cmaj9
wipe away the tears
Dm              Em        Am
just close your eyes dear.

Am
Into this night I wander
G                     D     Dsus
it's morning that I dread
Am
another day of knowing of
G                     D     Dsus
the path I fear to tread
Am
on into the sea of waking dreams
G                     D     Dsus
I follow without pride
F                       Am
nothing stands between us here
		   D
and I won't be denied.

F           Am
And I would be the one
             Cmaj9
to hold you down
           F
kiss you so hard
            Dm     Am      F
I'll take your breath away,
               Am
and after I'd

wipe away the tears

just close your eyes... 
The Gambler – Kenny Rogers
      
   D                            G               D
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
D                                                    A7
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
   D                                G             D
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
                          A7              D
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.

         D                             G                D
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
                                                        A7
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
       D                               G                 D
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
      G             D            A7            D
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."

     D                           G                  D
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
                                              A7
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
        D                                G                 D
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
                 G               D                  A7               D
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.

Chorus:
           D                     G             D
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
G            D                          A7
know when to walk away and know when to run.
          D     G    D                 G              D
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
            D    G          D        A7                D
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

EbD                          AbG            EbD
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
                                                  Bb7A7
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
       Eb                         Ab              Eb
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
        Ab                 Eb             Bb7       Eb
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."

    Eb                               Ab                       Eb
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
                                           Bb7
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
    Eb                             Ab                 Eb
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
    Ab            Eb                Bb7               Eb
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

Chorus:
           Eb                     Ab             Eb
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
Ab            Eb                          Bb7
know when to walk away and know when to run.
          Eb     Ab   Eb                 Ab              Eb
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
             Eb    Ab          Eb        Bb7                Eb
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

Hallelujah – Leonard Cohen
     
Intro: C Am C Am
        C                 Am
Now I've heard there was a secret chord,
     C                    Am
that David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   C                  F           G
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth,
    Am              F
the minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
    C               Am
you saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C         G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    C             F       G
She tied you to a kitchen chair,
    Am                         F
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

~Chorus~

     C               Am
Now, maybe there's a God above,
    C          Am
and all I ever learned from love,
    F               G              C        G
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

     C                 F       G
It's not a cry you can hear at night,
     Am                 F
it's not somebody who's seen the light,
       G               Em          Am
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

~Chorus~

    C                 Am      
Oh, people, I ve been here before,
  C                    Am
I know this room, I've walked this floor
  F             G             C        G
I used to live alone before I knew you.
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Am            F
Love is not a victory march
       G               Em          Am
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

~Chorus~
            C        Am
There was a time you let me know,
       C            Am
what's really going on below
    F             G              C       G
But now you never show it to me, do you?
      C             F        G
And remember when I moved in you
    Am            F
The holy dove was moving too
    G               Em            Am
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

~Chorus~

     C                Am
I ve done my best, it wasn't much,
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
     F                        G       C       G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             Em              Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

~Chorus 2x~

On a cloudy day
G                   Fadd9              C
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
G                     C
So won't you try to come

C     Am7                   C    
Come away with me and we'll kiss
Am7
On a mountaintop
C     Am7
Come away with me
         Em    Fadd9       C
And I'll never stop loving you

G             Fadd9            C
And I want to wake up with the rain
C
Falling on a tin roof
G         Fadd9              C
While I'm safe there in your arms
         G          C
So all I ask is for you
C        Am7                C     Am7
To come away with me in the night
C    G         C
Come away with me

Last week I left a note on Laura's desk

It said I love you signed anonymous friend

Turns out she's smarter than I thought she was

She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too

And I'm alone during couple skate

When the things that make me weak and strange get

It's gonna be the future soon

I've never seen it quite so clear

it's already here

D                             F#
I'll probably be some kind of scientist

I'll end world hunger I'll make dolphins speak

       G             A
I will do my best to teach them
      G                  A
About life and what it's worth
       G               G                 G           A
I just hope that I can keep them from destroying the Earth

~Chorus~

Bb                    F
Here on Earth they'll wonder
     Bb             D
As I piece by piece replace myself
        Bb                      F
And the steel and circuits will make me whole
Em                     A7sus4 A7
But I'll still feel so alone
Em                   Aaug
Until Laura calls me home

D                             F#
 I'll see her standing by the monorail
Bm                               D7
 She'll look the same except for bionic eyes
G                              Dmaj7
 She lost the real ones in the robot wars
G                               D        F# 
 I'll say I'm sorry, she'll say it's not your fault
   Bm
Or is it?
                   F#aug
And she eyes me suspiciously
Bm7                     E
Hearing the whir of the servos inside
         G                 A
She will scream and try to run
            G               A
But there's nowhere she can hide
       G            A                 G         A
When a crazy cyborg wants to make you his robot bride

~Chorus~

I closed my eyes and I sent it on its way

Been hoping that you'd drop in

So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start worry
Beautiful what’s your hurry?

And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar

So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry

Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there

Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there

I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now

Gm7  Gm7  C7  C7
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"
Mind if I move in closer

At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?

I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out

Paper Bag - Fiona Apple
         
      E              C         G             B7
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
   E           C           G              B7
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
      E              C           G          B7
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
        F7                  Em             A7
Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had
             E       C              G        B7
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
        E                        C
And I believed for a moment that my chances
       G               B7
Were approaching to be grabbed
          E         C              G     F7
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
  Em               A7               F7
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

Chorus:
       G            Cmaj7      F7          G
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
         G          Cmaj7         F7
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
         G                 Cmaj7         F7       G
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
       Em7                 A7             F7                G B7
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love

E          C      G    
And I went crazy again today,
B7            E                C             G           B7   E
looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
C                     G              B7              F7
Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine
      Em                A7
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
         E              C       G                   B7
I said, 'Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
E             C           G          B7
Come on put a little love here in my void,' 
              E           C                        G                        F7
He said 'It's all in your head,' and I said, 'So's everything' but he didn't get it
  Em               A7
I thought he was a man
           F7        
But he was just a little boy

Happily
        C        G
By the rosebush laughing
       C            G
With bruises on my chin
          F5	
The time when
            C               G
We counted every black car passing
      Am                G       
Your house beneath the hill
          F5	
And up until
         C                G
Someone caught us in the kitchen
      Am               G	
With maps, a mountain range
         F5	
A piggy bank
          C              G
A vision too removed to mention

And

 C               G
Please, remember me
    F5
Fondly
              C                    G
I heard from someone you're still pretty
     C                    G
And then they went on to say
                 F5
That the pearly gates
          C        G
Had such eloquent graffiti
       Am         G
Like "We'll meet again"
               F5
And "Fuck the man"
              C             G
And "Tell my mother not to worry"
     Am                G
And angels with their great
      F5
Handshakes
             C              G
Were always done in such a hurry

And

 C               G
Please, remember me
           F5
That Halloween
        C                G
Making fools of all the neighbors
     C             G
Our faces painted white
       F5
By midnight
         C           G
We'd forgotten one another
     Am               G
And when the morning came
        F5
I was ashamed
      C               G
Only now it seems so silly
      Am              G
That season left the world
            F5
And then returned
                C             G
And now you're lit up by the city

And

 C               G
Please, remember me
        F5
Mistakenly
        C             G
In the window of the tallest tower
 C              G
Calling passers-by
                F5
We're much too high
            C             G
To see the empty road at happy hour
 Am           G
Gleam and resonate
               F5
Just like the gates
            C    G
Around the holy kingdom
      Am                   G
With words like "Lost and found"
                 F5
And "Don't look down"
              C        G
And "Someone save Temptation"

And


 C               G
Please, remember me
            F5
As in the dream
           C        G
We had as rug-burn babies
 C                G
Among the fallen trees
              F5
We're fast asleep
            C             G
Beside the lions and the ladies
      Am                  G
That called you what you like
          F5
And even might
        C             G
Give a gift for your behavior
    Am                G
A fleeting chance to see
      F5
A trapeze
         C           G
Swinger high as any savior

And

 C               G
Please, remember me
       F5
My misery
            C             G
And how it lost me all I wanted
       C                  G
Those dogs that love the rain
              F5
And chasing trains
             C                 G
The colored birds above their running
    Am                 G
In circles around the well
               F5
And where it spells
        C               G
On the wall behind St. Peter
    Am               G
So bright on cinder gray
          F5
In spray paint
          C            G
"Who the hell can see forever?"

And

Seldomly
        C              G
In the car behind the carnival
    C                 G
My hand between your knees

You turned from me
                C               G
And said, "The trapeze act was wonderful
     Am             G
But never meant to last"

The clowns that passed

Saw me just come up with anger

A boy and girl

An angel kissing on a sinner

A monkey and a man

Buried in silk in the royal boudoir or going nuclear free

Or playing Crokinole with the Princess of Monaco
             F                 C     G                 C

Now some of you might be wondering how I came to be living in Canada
after being royalty in Spain. Should I tell them, guys?
Tell us, King!

         C                      F  
You see late one night when the palace was asleep
   F              C          G               C 
Out of my royal chambers and into the garden I creep
            C                                F
And I wait till the appointed time, when the moon is lighting the pitch
                   F                         C           G                    C
At which point my peasant friend, who looks just like me arrives and we make a switch!

C                                      F
Prince and pauper, junior and whopper, world made up of silver and copper
   F                   C                  G             
Under my own volition, I took a change of position
C                             F
So next time you drool in the pizza line
           F                   C
Remember, slower pizza's more luscious: the King of Spain never rushes!

Huey Lewis And The News – The Power Of Love

intro C  C/E | F  G | C  C/E | F    G |
      Cm7    | F    | Cm7    | F Bb F |

    Cm7      Bb        Cm7 (or Ab7 or F)
The power of love is a curious thing
               Bb           Cm7
make a one man weep, make another man sing
         Bb        Cm7
Change a hawk to a little white dove
            Bb      Cm7
more than a feeling    that's the power of love
| F  Gm7 |

Tougher than diamonds, bricks like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
make a bad one good make a wrong one right
power of love that keeps you home at night

Chorus 1 :
C               C/E    F           G
 You don't need money,  don't take fame
C              C/E            F         G
 Don't need no credit card to ride this train
     C               C/E               F          G
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
       Bb         F         Gsus4
but it might just save your life
G                     Cm7
 That's the power of love
F                     Cm7
 That's the power of love
F Bb F

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
that's the power makes the world go'round

Chorus 2 :
And it don't take money,  don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life

Eb              G7               Cm7
  They say that all in love is fair
yeah, but you don't care
Ab             Eb/G
  But you know what to do
Fm7             Eb
   when it gets hold of you
Ab                 Gsus4
  and with a little help from above
G                       Cm7
 you feel the power of love
F                       Cm7
 you feel the power of love
F
 Can you feel it ?
Cm7     F Cm7 Bb
   Hmmm

Chorus 3 :
It don't take money and it don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
C          C/E         F            G
 you won't feel nothin' till you feel
C               C/E F           Gsus4
 you feel the power, just the power of love
C             C/E F             Gsus4      C
 That's the power, that's the power of love
F             G
 You feel the power of love
C F             G            C
   you feel the power of love
