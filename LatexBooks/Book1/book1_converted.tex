For Emily Whenever I May Find Her â Simon and Garfunkel

\[D]What a dream I had
\[G]Pressed in organd\[Em]y
\[D]Clothed in crinoline
\[Cmj7]Of smoky burgundy
\[G]Softer tha\[A]n the rain


\[D]I \[â]wandered empty streets down
\[G]Past the shop dis\[Em]plays
\[D]I \[â]heard cathedral bells
\[Cmj7]Dripping down the alleyways
\[G]As I\[A] walked on


\[D]And when you ran to me, your
\[G]Cheeks flushed with the \[Em]night
\[D]We walked on frosted fields
\[Cmj7]Of juniper and lamplight
\[G]I h\[A]eld your hand


\[D]And when I awoke
\[G]And felt you warm and \[Em]near
\[D]I \[â]kissed your honey hair
\[Cmj7]With my grateful tears
\[G]Oh, I love \[A]you girl

Homeward Bound â Simon and Garfunkel




I'm\[A] sitting in the railway station.
Got a\[Amaj7] ticket for my destinat\[A7]ion, m\[F#]mmm
\[Bm]On a tour of one-night stands my \[G]suitcase and guitar in hand.
And\[A] ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a\[E7] poet and one-man\[A] band.


Homeward\[D] bound,  wish\[A] I was,
Homeward\[D] bound,
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]thought's escaping
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]music's playing,
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]love lays waiting
\[E]Silently for\[A] me.


\[A]Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of\[Amaj7] cigarettes and maga\[A7]zines, m\[F#]mmm
And\[Bm] each town looks the same to me, the\[G] movies and the factories
And\[A] ev'ry stranger's face I see r\[E7]eminds me that I long to \[A]be,


Homeward\[D] bound,  wish\[A] I was,
Homeward\[D] bound,
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]thought's escaping
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]music's playing,
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]love lays waiting
\[E]Silently for\[A] me.


T\[A]onight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll\[Amaj7] play the game and pre\[A7]tend, m\[F#]mmm
But\[Bm] all my words come back to me in\[G] shades of mediocrity
Like\[A] emptiness in harmony I\[E7] need someone to comfort\[A] me.

Homeward\[D] bound,  wish\[A] I was,
Homeward\[D] bound,
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]thought's escaping

Sound of Silence â Simon and Garfunkel



\[Am]  Hello darkness, my old f\[G]riend,
I've come to talk with you\[Am] again,
Because a vision sof\[F]tly cree\[C]ping,
Left it's seeds while I\[F] was sle\[C]eping,
And the\[F] vision that was planted in my\[C] brain
Still r\[Am]emains
Within the\[G] sound of\[Am] silence.


In restless dreams I walked a\[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobbl\[Am]estone,
'neath the halo of\[F] a street\[C] lamp,
I turned my collar to the\[F] cold and\[C] damp
When my\[F] eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon\[C] light                Am
That split the night
And touched the\[G] sound of\[Am] silence.


And in the naked light I\[G] saw
Ten thousand people, maybe\[Am] more.
People talking wit\[F]hout spe\[C]aking,
People hearing wit\[F]hout list\[C]ening,
People writing\[F] songs that voices never\[C] share

And no one\[Am] dare
Disturb the\[G] sound of\[Am] silence.
Fools said ah, you do not\[G] know
Silence like a cancer\[Am] grows.
Hear my words that I\[F] might teach\[C] you,
Take my arms that I\[F] might reach\[C] you.
But my\[F] words like silent raindrops\[C] fell,

And echoed
In the\[G] wells of\[Am] silence


And the people bowed and\[G] prayed
To the neon God they\[Am] made.
And the sign flashed out\[F] it's wa\[C]rning,
In the words that it \[F]was fo\[C]rming.
And the sign said, the\[F] words of the prophets
Are\[Am] written on the subway\[C] walls
And tenement\[C] halls.
And\[Am] whisper'd in the\[G] sounds of\[Am] silence.
                    /                 /

Staring At The Sun â U2

Intro: Am,G,F,Em x3

Verse 1:

\[Am]Summer stretching on the \[G]grass
\[F]Summer dresses \[Em]pass
\[Am]In the shade \[G]of a willow tree
\[F]Creeps a crawling \[Em]over me
\[Am]Over me and \[G]over you
\[F]Stuck together \[Em]with God`s glue
\[Am]It`s going to get \[G]stickier too

\[F]It`s been a long hot summer
\[F#m-5]Let`s get under the covers
\[F]Don`t try too hard to think
\[G]Don`t think at all

I`m not the only\[C] one
Starin` at the\[Am] sun
Afraid of what you`d\[F] find
If you took a look\[G] inside
Not just deaf and\[C] dumb
Staring at the\[Am] sun
Not the only\[F] one
Who`s happy to go\[G] blind

Am, D x2




Verse 2:

There`s an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won`t disappear
It`s gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you want to see what the scratching brings
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?
`Cause those that can`t do often have to
Those that can`t do often have to preach

Chorus:

To the ones staring at the sun
Afraid of what you`d find
If you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb Staring at the sun
I`m not the only one
Who`s happy to go blind

Verse 3:

Intransigence is all around
Military still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won`t say goodbye
Referee won`t blow the whistle
God is good but will he listen
I`m nearly great
But there`s something I`m missing
I left in the duty free
Though you never really belonged to me

Chorus:

You`re not the only one
Starin` at the sun
Afraid of what you`d find
If you stepped back inside
I`m not sucking my thumb
I`m staring at the sun
Not the only one
Whoâs happy to go blind

\[F]Ah ah \[F#m-5]I
Ah ah I
Ah ah I
Ah ah I

\[C]I am just a poor boy, though my storyâs sel\[Am]dom told
I have\[G] squandered my resistance for a\[G7] pocketful of mumbles,
such are\[C] promises
 All lies and\[Am] jest, still a\[G] man hears what he\[F] wants to hear
and disregard\[C]s rest\[G].\\[G7][C]\[G]

When I\[C] left my home and my family, I was no more than a\[Am] boy
In the\[G] company of strangers, in th\[G7]e quiet of \[G]a railway
station\[C], running scared
Laying\[Am] low, seeking\[G] out the poorer quarters where the ragged
people\[C] go
Looking\[G] for the places\[F] only\[G] they\[G7] would\[C] know.

Lie-la\[Am]-lie,
Lie-la\[G]-lie la lie-la-lie,
Lie-la\[Am]-lie
Lie-l\[G]a-lie, la la la la lie, la la la \[C]la lie.

Asking\[C] only workmanâs wages, I come looking for\[Am] a job
But I get no\[G] offers,
just a\[G7] come-on from the\[G] whores on 7th\[C] Avenue
I do d\[Am]eclare there were\[G] times when I was\[F] so lonesome,
I took some comfo\[C]rt the\[G]re\[G7]\[C\[G]]
Ooh la la, la la la la.


\[C] \[Am] \[G] \[C] \[Am] \[G] \[F] \[C] 
Lie-la\[Am]-lie,
Lie-la\[G]-lie la lie-la-lie,
Lie-la\[Am]-lie
Lie-l\[G]a-lie, la la la la lie, la la la \[C]la lie.

And Iâ\[C]m laying out my winter clothes and wishing I w\[Am]as gone
Going\[G] home, where th\[G7]e New York City winters arenât
\[C]Bleeding me, \[G]Leading me, \[Am]going \[G]home.

In the\[C] clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his\[Am] trade
And he\[G] carries the reminders \[G7]of every glove t\[G]hat laid him down
Or\[C] cut him till he cried out in his anger and his\[Am] shame
âI \[G]am leaving, I \[F]am leavingâ but the fighter stil\[C]l remains.


\[G] \[G7] \[G] \[C] 
Lie-la\[Am]-lie,
Lie-la\[G]-lie la lie-la-lie,
Lie-la\[Am]-lie
Lie-l\[G]a-lie, la la la la lie, la la la \[C]la lie.



Boys of Summer â Don Henley


\[Em]Nobody on the road
\[Em]Nobody on the beach
\[C]I feel it in the air
\[C]The summer's out of reach
\[D]Empty lake, empty streets
\[D]The sun goes down alone
\[C]I'm drivin' by your house
\[C]Though I know you're not at home

\[G]But I can see you-
\[D]Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
\[D]Ydou got your hair combed back and you\[C]r sunglasses on, baby   G                    D
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
\[D]After the boys of \[C]summer have gone

\[Em]I never will forget those nights
\[Em]wonder if it was a dream
\[C]Remember how you made me crazy?
\[C]Remember how I made you scream
\[D]Now I don't understand
\[D]what happened to our love
\[C]But babe, I'm gonna get you back
\[C]I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone   I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

\[Em]Out on the road today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a Cadillac
\[C]A little voice Inside my head said,
\[C]Don't look back. You can never look back.
\[D]I thought I knew what love was
\[D]what did I know?
\[C]Those days are gone forever
\[C]I should just let them go but-

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby   I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone





The Hounds of Winter â Sting




Intro: A Abm Bm A D Bm E F# (2x)
\[A]Mercury \[Abm]falling
\[Bm]I rise from my \[A]bed
\[D]Collect my thoughts toget\[Bm]her
\[E]I have to hold my \[F#]head
\[A]It seems that she's \[G#m]gone
\[Bm]And somehow I am \[A]pinned by
\[D]The Hounds of \[Bm]Winter
\[E]Howling in the \[F#]wind

I walk through the day
My coat around my ears
I look for my companion
I have to dry my tears
It seems that she's gone
Leaving me too soon
I'm as dark as December
I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon

I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down



I can't make up the fire
The way that she could
I spend all my days
In the search for dry wood
Board all the windows and
close the front door
I can't believe
she won't be here anymore

I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down

A season for joy
A season for sorrow
Where she's gone
I will surely, surely follow
She brightened my day
She warmed the coldest night
The Hounds of Winter
They got me in their sights

I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome, lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They harry me down



USS Make Shit Up - Voltaire




\[D]Ve\[G]rs\[D]e \[A]1:\[D]\[\[G]D]\[A]
\[D]I was stranded on a planet, \[G]just me and Spock
\[D]we met a nasty nazi alien who \[A]locked our asses up
\[D]We found a hunk of crystal and a \[G]metal piece of bed
\[A]We made a laser phaser gun and shot him in the \[D]head

\[D]I was standing on a bridge when \[G]Sulu came to me
\[D]his eyes were full of tears he said "\[A]captain cant you see
\[D]the ship is gonna blow do \[G]something I beseech"
\[A]I grabbed a tribble and some chewing gum and stopped the
warp core\[D] breach

Chorus:
and I say
\[D]Bounce a graviton particle beam \[G]off the main deflector dish
\[D]thats the way we do things lad \[A]We make shit up as we wish
\[D]the klingons and the romulans \[G]pose no threat to us
\[A]cuz if we find we're in a bind we just make some shit \[D]up

\[D]la, \[G]da da \[F#m]da, da da da, la da da da da \[G]daaa, \[A]daaa

Verse 2:
Although heâs just a child and something of a twit
Wesley is the master when it comes to making up some shit
he's the guy you want with you when you go out in space
if only he could beam those pimples off his face

and if you're at a party on the starship enterprise
and the karaoke player just plain old up and dies
set up an neutrino field inside a can of peas
hold on to Geordi's visor and sing into data's knee

Chorus

Verse 3:
Sisko's on a mission to go no bloody place
he loiters on the space station above Bajoran space
the wormhole opened up and now they come from near and far
we'll keep the booze but please send back the fucking Jem-hadar

What is with the Klingons, remember in the day
they looked like Puerto Ricans and they dressed in gold lamÃ©
now they look like heavy metal rockers from the dead
with leather pants and frizzy hair and lobsters on their heads

Chorus

Verse 4:
I was stuck on Voyager and pounding on the door
when suddenly it dawned on me I've seen this show before
perhaps I'm in a warp bubble and slightly out of phase
It was way back in the sixties when they called it Lost in Space

we were looking for a way to â
make the ratings soar
so we orchestrated an encounter with the Borg
normally you'd think that would get us into shit
But this one has a smashing ass and a lovely set of tits

Chorus (End):
and I say
Bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish
That's the way we do things lad We make shit up as we wish
the Klingons and the Romulans pose no threat to us
\[A]cuz if we find we're in a bind we're \[G]totally screwed but nevermind
\[A]we'll pull something out of our behind...
\[A]weâll just make some shi\[D]t up

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
but Iâll know where several are
if my dreams get real bizarre
'cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

Chorus (x2)

\[Am]I'd like to make \[C]myself be\[G]lieve
