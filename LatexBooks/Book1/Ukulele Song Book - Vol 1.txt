American Pie – Don McLean
 

 
 G     D    Em7
A long, long time ago,
 Am            C                Em                   D
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
    G      D    Em7
And I know if I had my chance,
    Am                 C                Em              C           D
That I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while
   Em      Am                   Em          Am
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver
C        G      Am        C                        D
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
 G          D        Em           Am7            D
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
G         D          Em
Something touched me deep inside
   C       D7    G    C   G
The day the music died  
 
 
CHORUS:

  G    C        G        D
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
        G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
        G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
       Em                          A7   Em                          D7
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
 
 
G                 Am      
Did you write the book of love
      C                 Am         Em           D
And do you have faith in god above, if the bible tells you so?
G      D          Em
Do you believe in rock and roll
   Am7             C               Em                      A7       D
Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
      Em                  D                     Em              D
Well I know that you're in love with him  'cuz I saw you dancin' in the gym
   C           G        A7           C                    D7
You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues  
       G      D       Em                   Am                   C
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck  
   G      D     Em              C       D7    G  C  G
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died, I started singin'  
 
 
CHORUS  
 
            G                                Am
Now for ten years we've been on our own,
     C                              Am                                      Em                           D  
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that's not how it used to be
              G          D                    Em
When the jester sang for the king and queen  
       Am7          C                                              Em               A7                           D
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean in a voice that came from you and me  
 
 
 
     Em                             D                           Em                         D
And while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown  
     C              G          A7           C                          D7
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
               G         D         Em                          Am                                    C  
And while Lenon read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park
     G             D                    Em            C           D7        G    C  G  
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died, we were singin'    
 
CHORUS  
 
 
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter, eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
the players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now at halftime there was sweet perfume, while sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance
'Cuz the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died, we started singin'  
 
 
CHORUS
 
 
And there we were all in one place,
a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,
Jack Flash sat on a candle stick, 'cuz fire is the devil's only friend
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died, he was singin'  
 
 
CHORUS
 
  G     D        Em
I met a girl who sang the blues  
     Am                 C               Em                          D
And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away  
 G         D      Em
I went down to the sacred store  
         Am              C                     Em                 C
Where I'd heard the music years before, but the man there said the music          D
wouldn't play  
   Em                 Am                     Em                   Am
But in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
   C     G        Am          C                     D
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken                                               
G         D   Em                    Am7     C            D7
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost  
G               D          Em                Am7     D7    G
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,  
D7
And they were singin'  
 
FINAL CHORUS:  

So bye, bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry    
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye

       C                D7         G    C   G
Singin' this will be the day that I die.

Can you show me where it hurts?
 
D                          A
There is no pain you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves
C                                           G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
  D                        A
My hands felt just like two ballons
C                               G
Now I've got that feeling once again
                    C

Can you stand up?

When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
D                       A
Out of the corner of my eye
C                           G
I turned to look but it was gone

I cannot put my finger on it now
 
The child is grown

The dream is gone

For Emily Whenever I May Find Her – Simon and Garfunkel
 
D                  
What a dream I had
G                Em
Pressed in organdy
D
Clothed in crinoline
Cmj7
Of smoky burgundy
G         A
Softer than the rain  
 
 
D ​
I wandered empty streets down
G                Em  
Past the shop displays
D ​
I heard cathedral bells
Cmj7
Dripping down the alleyways
G   A
As I walked on  
 
 
D
And when you ran to me, your
G                       Em  
Cheeks flushed with the night
D
We walked on frosted fields
Cmj7
Of juniper and lamplight
G  A  
I held your hand

And when I awoke
G                     Em
And felt you warm and near

I kissed your honey hair

Oh, I love you girl

Oh, I love you
 
 
Homeward Bound – Simon and Garfunkel
 


 
   A
I'm sitting in the railway station.
     Amaj7                  A7    F#
Got a ticket for my destination, mmmm
Bm                               G
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
   A                                  E7               A
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band.  
 
 
        D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
        D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought's escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music's playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.
 
 
A
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
  Amaj7               A7      F#
Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm
   Bm                                  G
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
   A                             E7                       A
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,  
 
 
        D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
        D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought's escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music's playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.
 
 
 A
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
    Amaj7                 A7     F#
I'll play the game and pretend, mmmm
   Bm                              G
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
    A                      E7                      A
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.    
 
        D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
        D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought's escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music's playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.
Amaj7       A7       A  
  Silently for me.

Sound of Silence – Simon and Garfunkel
 

 
Am                        G    
  Hello darkness, my old friend,
                          Am
I've come to talk with you again,
                    F       C
Because a vision softly creeping,
                       F       C
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping,
       F                             C
And the vision that was planted in my brain
       Am
Still remains
          G        Am
Within the sound of silence.
 
 
                             G
In restless dreams I walked alone
                       Am
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                  F        C
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                         F        C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
       F                                        C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light                Am
That split the night
               G        Am
And touched the sound of silence.
 
 
                        G
And in the naked light I saw
                          Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                  F       C
People talking without speaking,
                  F        C
People hearing without listening,
              F                       C
People writing songs that voices never share
 
          Am
And no one dare
           G        Am
Disturb the sound of silence.
                         G
Fools said ah, you do not know
                     Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
                    F           C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                   F           C
Take my arms that I might reach you.
      F                           C
But my words like silent raindrops fell,  
 
And echoed
      G        Am
In the wells of silence
 
 
                        G
And the people bowed and prayed
                    Am
To the neon God they made.
                        F       C
And the sign flashed out it's warning,
                     F     C
In the words that it was forming.
                      F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
   Am                    C
Are written on the subway walls
            C
And tenement halls.
   Am               G         Am
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.
                    /                 /                    
         Picking, here           to here
 
 

Staring At The Sun – U2
 
Intro: Am,G,F,Em x3
 
Verse 1:
 
Am                       G
Summer stretching on the grass
F              Em
Summer dresses pass
Am           G
In the shade of a willow tree
F                 Em
Creeps a crawling over me
Am          G
Over me and over you
F              Em
Stuck together with God`s glue
Am                G
It`s going to get stickier too
 
F
It`s been a long hot summer
F#m-5
Let`s get under the covers
F
Don`t try too hard to think
G
Don`t think at all
 
                C
I`m not the only one
              Am
Starin` at the sun
                    F
Afraid of what you`d find
                  G
If you took a look inside
                 C
Not just deaf and dumb
              Am
Staring at the sun
            F
Not the only one
                 G
Who`s happy to go blind
 
Am, D x2
 
 
 
 
Verse 2:
 
There`s an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won`t disappear
It`s gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you want to see what the scratching brings
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?
`Cause those that can`t do often have to
Those that can`t do often have to preach
 
Chorus:
 
To the ones staring at the sun
Afraid of what you`d find
If you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb Staring at the sun
I`m not the only one
Who`s happy to go blind
 
Verse 3:
 
Intransigence is all around
Military still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won`t say goodbye
Referee won`t blow the whistle
God is good but will he listen
I`m nearly great
But there`s something I`m missing
I left in the duty free
Though you never really belonged to me
 
Chorus:
 
You`re not the only one
Starin` at the sun
Afraid of what you`d find
If you stepped back inside
I`m not sucking my thumb
I`m staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who’s happy to go blind
 
F     F#m-5
Ah ah I
Ah ah I

The Boxer – Simon and Garfunkel

C                                            Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story’s seldom told        
      G                              G7
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles,
        C
such are promises
             Am            G                 F 
 All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear

and disregards rest.
 
      C                                                Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
      G                           G7         G                  
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of a railway
       C  
station, running scared
      Am           G                    
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged
      C
people go
       G              F    G    G7    C
Looking for the places only they would know.

      C                                          Am
Asking only workman’s wages, I come looking for a job

But I get no offers,

just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue

Going home, where the New York City winters aren’t

Boys of Summer – Don Henley

 
Em
Nobody on the road  
Em
Nobody on the beach  
C                    
I feel it in the air  
C
The summer's out of reach  
D                        
Empty lake, empty streets  
D
The sun goes down alone  
C                          
I'm drivin' by your house  
C
Though I know you're not at home      
 
G  
But I can see you-  
D  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
D                                     C    
Ydou got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby   G                    D  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
D                 C                  
After the boys of summer have gone      
 
Em
I never will forget those nights  
Em
wonder if it was a dream  
C
Remember how you made me crazy?
C
Remember how I made you scream  
D                    
Now I don't understand
D
what happened to our love  
C  
But babe, I'm gonna get you back                        
C
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of      
I can see you-  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone   I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone      
 
Em                                
Out on the road today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a Cadillac  
C                                      
A little voice Inside my head said,
C
Don't look back. You can never look back.  
D  
I thought I knew what love was  
D  
what did I know?  
C  
Those days are gone forever    
C
I should just let them go but-      
 
I can see you-  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong   After the boys of summer have gone      
 
I can see you-  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby   I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone    
 
 
 
 

The Hounds of Winter – Sting
 


 
Intro: A Abm Bm A D Bm E F# (2x)
A       Abm
Mercury falling
Bm             A
I rise from my bed
D                        Bm
Collect my thoughts together
E                 F#
I have to hold my head
A                   G#m
It seems that she's gone
Bm               A
And somehow I am pinned by
D             Bm
The Hounds of Winter
E              F#
Howling in the wind
 
I walk through the day
My coat around my ears
I look for my companion
I have to dry my tears
It seems that she's gone
Leaving me too soon
I'm as dark as December
I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon
 
I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down
 
 
 
I can't make up the fire
The way that she could
I spend all my days
In the search for dry wood
Board all the windows and
close the front door
I can't believe
she won't be here anymore
 
I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down
 
A season for joy
A season for sorrow
Where she's gone
I will surely, surely follow
She brightened my day
She warmed the coldest night
The Hounds of Winter
They got me in their sights
 
I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome, lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They harry me down
 
 

USS Make Shit Up - Voltaire
 

 
D G D A D G A D
 
Verse 1:
D                           G
I was stranded on a planet, just me and Spock
D                             A
we met a nasty nazi alien who locked our asses up
D                                G
We found a hunk of crystal and a metal piece of bed
A                                              D
We made a laser phaser gun and shot him in the head
 
D                               G
I was standing on a bridge when Sulu came to me
D                                    A
his eyes were full of tears he said "captain cant you see
D                         G
the ship is gonna blow do something I beseech"
A                                                  
I grabbed a tribble and some chewing gum and stopped the
         D
warp core breach
 
Chorus:
and I say
D                               G
Bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish
D                              A
thats the way we do things lad We make shit up as we wish
D                             G
the klingons and the romulans pose no threat to us
A                                                     D
cuz if we find we're in a bind we just make some shit up
 
D   G     F#m                          G     A
la, da da da, da da da, la da da da da daaa, daaa
 
Verse 2:
Although he’s just a child and something of a twit
Wesley is the master when it comes to making up some shit
he's the guy you want with you when you go out in space
if only he could beam those pimples off his face
 
and if you're at a party on the starship enterprise
and the karaoke player just plain old up and dies
set up an neutrino field inside a can of peas
hold on to Geordi's visor and sing into data's knee
 
Chorus
 
Verse 3:
Sisko's on a mission to go no bloody place
he loiters on the space station above Bajoran space
the wormhole opened up and now they come from near and far
we'll keep the booze but please send back the fucking Jem-hadar
 
What is with the Klingons, remember in the day
they looked like Puerto Ricans and they dressed in gold lamé
now they look like heavy metal rockers from the dead
with leather pants and frizzy hair and lobsters on their heads
 
Chorus
 
Verse 4:
I was stuck on Voyager and pounding on the door
when suddenly it dawned on me I've seen this show before
perhaps I'm in a warp bubble and slightly out of phase
It was way back in the sixties when they called it Lost in Space
 
we were looking for a way to ​
make the ratings soar
so we orchestrated an encounter with the Borg
normally you'd think that would get us into shit
But this one has a smashing ass and a lovely set of tits
 
Chorus (End):
and I say
Bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish
That's the way we do things lad We make shit up as we wish
the Klingons and the Romulans pose no threat to us
A                                    G
cuz if we find we're in a bind we're totally screwed but nevermind
A
we'll pull something out of our behind...
A                         D
we’ll just make some shit up

C                          G
You would not believe your eyes

If ten million fireflies
C                         G       Am     F
lit up the world as I fell asleep
C                          G
'Cause they'd fill the open air

when I'm far too tired to fall asleep
 
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
but I’ll know where several are
if my dreams get real bizarre
'cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
