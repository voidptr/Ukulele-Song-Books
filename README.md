# UKULELE SONG BOOKS

I don't own the copyright to any of these. Most tabs and chord sheets I adapted from Ultimate Guitar, though a few I transcribed myself, or got from the original artist pages/videos.

## How is this repo organized?

### PDFs
Typeset PDFs, ready to print, in 8.5x5.5 paper size. For pre-arranged booklet-style pdfs, look in the Archive directory

### LaTexBooks
I'm slowly typesetting all the books in LaTex. Volume 7 is exclusively available in LaTex, so look in here for that one.

Required Latex packages include "songs", and the Lilypond program/library.

### DOCXs
I originally "typeset" the books in Word. The original files are in here.

### Text
For your convenience, all the songs were copied and pasted into a text document. The chords SHOULD line up, but YMMV. I recommend using the DOCX or LaTex files instead.

### Archive
I've gone through quite a series of iterations, and their carcasses are stored in this freezer.
